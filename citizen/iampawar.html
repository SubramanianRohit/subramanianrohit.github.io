<span lang="EN-GB">India is a land of great men – from Chanakya
to Chetan Bhagat, from Mahatma Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi, from Raj Kapoor to
Ranbir Kapoor and from the Mauryas to Mayawati. Ruffle through the pages of
India’s past and you’ll come across so many individuals who have changed the
course of history. But I don’t think anyone will come anywhere close to
challenging the greatness and respectability of the greatest Man of our times –
not even Arindham Chaudary and Kamaal R Khan. I talk of course, of the Leader
of the Masses, the Shivaji of the Marathi Manoos, the hero of the middle class,
God of the farmers, the destroyer of the Lalit Modis - Sharad Pawar.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB"><br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB">Sharad Pawarji is easily the most inspiring
person I have ever seen. His tryst with greatness started when he was a young
college student. Back then, the extremely cruel and horrific social evil called
ragging was widely prevalent in the country. Among other crimes inflicted upon
them, students across the country were wary of seniors who took away all the
cash that they had with them. It was under those circumstances, that one
particular boy hid all the cash that he had inside his underwear and told the
seniors he had no cash with him. Seniors were always surprised how this rich
looking boy had no money with him, and threatened him with consequences if he didn’t
give all the money he had, and he kept repeating those legendary words – “I
have only 12 rupees”. They never found out his little dirty secret. The young
Sharad Pawar became a hero overnight, and his method widely popular – among students
and non-students (politicians, bureaucrats, etc) alike. Those incidents had a permanent
impact on him. Forty years later Sharad Pawar still keeps his money safe from
thugs and dacoits and from the IT Department by a similar technique. (Of course
he has only 12 cr. Not a penny more.)</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB"><br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB">That Sharad Pawar is a great cricketer
needs no mention. No, he’s never played the sport, and I actually doubt if he
even knows the rules of the game properly, but he’s done everything else that
one can possibly do in the game. He created wealth in the country, more wealth than
N.R.Narayanamurthy, Shiv Nadar and Azim Premji put together. Under his
Presidency, many people like Lalit Modi became some of the richest men in the
country. After ages of indifference, the BCCI finally started to make a lot of
money. Who else can you attribute this to but Sharad Pawarji. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB">During his BCCI Presidency, he had a dream
of making the Indian Cricket Team the best in the World. BCCI was already the
richest in the World. So he decided to become the ICC President and ICC obliged
(Sharad Pawar never fails) almost instantly. Once the ICC President, achieving his
vision became a lot simpler. He made it ICC policy to sack any umpire who
declared Indian batsmen out. (Yes, Daryl Harper deserved that didn’t he?) He
ensured that India played 5 series while South Africa didn’t get any series at
all. He ensured that India played only in India while Australia had to travel
around the World, including to India, for every series. Of course he made an
error in judgement when he thought that India could go to England and win,
probably got carried away under the impression he himself created. Anyway, as
long as he is there as the ICC President, we needn’t worry, for it is only a
matter of time before India is back to the top. (And trust me it’s only a
matter of time before Stuart Broad is banned for Match fixing or for a dope
scandal. The fuckers been playing so well against India... How Dare He!!) <span>&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<span lang="EN-GB">Now you tell me, how will you feel if one
person who is doing so much to help the country’s image feel when some random
guy who was unknown until yesterday, comes along and wants to change the way Sports
is managed in the country? Obviously Sharad Pawarji is pissed off with that
Ajay Maken guy. He has a reason to be so. If that Ajay Maken wants to remove
corruption from Sports, then I ask, who can be a bigger proponent for the fight
against corruption than Sharad Pawarji? Does anyone even know that Sharad
Pawarji was heading the Panel of Ministers on Anti-Corruption before “Team Anna”
appeared? That means that he was India’s last anti-corruption crusader before
Anna Hazare. In fact, when his right hand man and idealogical son, Lalit Modi
had allegations of corruptions against him, Sharad Pawarji immediately removed
him from BCCI and drove him out of the country. And yet, Ajay Maken wants to
act like he’s some big appatucker fellow by fighting against Sharad Pawarji. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB">Throughout his life, Sharad Pawarji’s
contribution to the country has been immense. So, we Sharad Pawar supporters
are planning to file a petition in Supreme Court to give Sharad Pawarji the
Bharat Ratna. (as always the GoI does things only when Supreme Court ‘directs’
it to do) One fundamental reason I hate the Shiv Sena and Bal Thackerey is that
they always keep asking for Bharat Ratna for Sachin whenever he scores runs (in
double digits), but never say that another fellow Maharashtrian – Sharad Pawarji
– deserves the Bharat Ratna more than anyone else who has ever received it. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB"><br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB">The greatness of Sharad Pawarji is undisputed.
In fact even Albert Einstein once remarked “Scarcely can I believe that such a
man walked in flesh and blood on this planet”. <span>&nbsp;</span>It has always been, and always shall be my
endeavour to be a Sharad Pawar in whatever I do in future. That is the only way
I can become a great man like Sharad Pawarji. Yes, Proud to say. #IamPawar</span></div>

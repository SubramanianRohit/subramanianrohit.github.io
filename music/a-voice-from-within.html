            <h1>94. A Voice from Within</h1>

            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>It’s always surprised me that despite centuries of Musical Traditions, the sound that characterizes the early years of Tamil cinema is in fact the Clarinet. Immortalized by the AVM Studios Intro, the clarinet is an immediate ticket to a bygone era!</p>

                <p>Perhaps that’s why A.R. Rahman reaches for the clarinet in Kaaviyathalaivan — not just as an instrument, but as a timestamp, a time-travel trigger. To guide our senses to a pre-Independence Madras story revolving the lives of actors who work in a Drama Company — the foremost form of mass entertainment before movies became mainstream. Vasanthabalan’s aesthetics and Rahman’s music in Kaaviyathalaivan transported me to a different era in Madras. And the one song that encapsulates the sound design in this album is Yaarumila, sung by Shweta Mohan with an assist from Srinivas.</p>

                <p>Over the years, on road trips with friends, I’ve often tried to sneak Yaarumila into the playlist. Without fail, someone notices — not because they love it, but because they want to skip it. This song is no one’s favorite. It’s mine.</p>

                <p>How can it not be? Once the opening tune on the clarinet hooks you, the flute ably carries you to the vocals from Shweta Mohan and then the Tabla ably walks with you through the rest of the simple but layered orchestration that at different points features strings, veena and the piano for the remaining 4 minutes.</p>

                <p>Even with all the rich layering of music, the song doesn’t sound busy. Much to the delight of older members of my family, the song spotlights the vocals instead of blurring it in with the music, again in a nod to early era Tamil cinema music. The lyrics also bear mention, as it is not set to the usual poetic structure. A crude oversimplification of the lyrical style would be to say that it is basically 3 long, descriptive, evocative sentences. It is conversational and literary and cannot have been easy to fit this into a song. And yet, its put together beautifully.</p>

                <p>The song counts among Shweta Mohan’s best — especially endearing for its distinct Netru Illadha Maatram vibes from nearly 20 years before in one of Rahman’s earliest albums, working with Sujatha, Shweta’s mother. (Rahman truly transcends generations!)</p>

                <p>Each of the three sections of the song showcase a different musical concept and the song ebbs and flows to the protagonist’s emotions, pining in love for the guy that doesn’t notice her.</p>

                <p>Rahman’s stable of Female Love Songs is very well stocked — many of which are or will be discussed in this collection. But Yaarumila is a unique offering — contemporary in production, rooted in time and tradition — and it deserves to be remembered!</p>
